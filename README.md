# Dummy Reversal Tool

This is a tool for Melty Blood Actress Again Current code developed by gonp.

The in-game options for reversals are limited in their functionality, hence the creation of this tool.


# How to use
1. Download Dummy_Reversals.exe from the latest release.

2. Run it with the game open and in training mode.

3. Take control of the dummy (via FN1 in training, or via a Dummy Recording) and do the move you would like the dummy to do as a reversal.

4. Pause the game and press "-" on your keyboard.

5. Press "=" on your keyboard to cycle between reversal settings: OFF, ONCE, ALWAYS


# Notes

Some moves change pattern part way through the move. For this reason, it is recommended to try to save the reversal action very early into the desired move.

Moves that change whether they are airborne or not midway also need to be saved at the beginning, before they have transitioned.

This tool works by forcing player 2 to do the specified action upon noticing a neutral frame which comes with some side-effects and limitations.

If the dummy is set to do a grounded move but recovers mid air, they will not do the reversal at all (same vice-versa).

Moves that normally become unperformable will still be performed (e.g. C-Vaki can do pit set even if one is already set, metered moves can be done without meter).

The dummy is not actually inputting anything, so it will not do charge moves or variations other than the default version of a move.

There is a workaround for this:

1. Hit the dummy and try to pause on the first frame of the reversal.

2. Once you successfully pause on the right frame, start a dummy recording and record the followups you want.

3. Set the Dummy to Recover

4. The dummy will now do both the reversal move, as well as your recorded inputs

Be aware of a bug where if an input is held for the first frame of a recording, the dummy will repeatedly do that input even while not in playback.

This makes doing this method for charged moves very annoying.
