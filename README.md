# Dummy Reversal Tool

This is a tool for Melty Blood Actress Again Current code developed by gonp.

The in-game options for reversals are limited in their functionality, hence the creation of this tool.


# How to use
1. Download Dummy_Reversals.exe from the latest release.

2. Run it with the game open and in training mode.

3. Take control of the dummy (via FN1 in training, or via a Dummy Recording) and do the move you would like the dummy to do as a reversal.

4. Pause the game and press "-" on your keyboard.

5. Press "=" on your keyboard to toggle whether the cpu will do the reversal action.

# Notes

This tool works by forcing player 2 to do the specified action which comes with some side-effects and limitations.

If the dummy is set to perform a grounded move but recovers mid-air, they will still perform the grounded move, leaving them floating.

The same goes vice-versa for setting an airborne move but recovering grounded.

Moves that normally become unperformable will still be performed (e.g. C-Vaki can do pit set even if one is already set).

The dummy is not actually inputting anything, so it can not do charge moves or variations other than the default version of a move.
